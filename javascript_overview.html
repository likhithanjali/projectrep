<h1 style="color:#000080";>Overview Of JavaScript</h1/>
<h3>What is JavaScript ?</h3>
<p>Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.<br>

JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>

<h3>standard version of the core JavaScript language.</h3>

<ul><li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>

<li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>

<li>Complementary to and integrated with Java.</li>

<li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.</li>

<li>Open and cross-platform</li></ul>

<h3>Client-side JavaScript</h3>
<p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.<br>

It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.<br>

The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.<br>

The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.<br>

JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.</p>

<h3>Advantages of JavaScript</h3>

<p>The merits of using JavaScript are -</p>

<ul><li><b>Less server interaction -</b> You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.</li>


<li><b>Immediate feedback to the visitors -</b> They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.</li>


<li><b>Increased interactivity -</b> You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.</li>


<li><b>Richer interfaces -</b> You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.</li></ul>

<h3>Limitations of JavaScript</h3>
<p>We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features -</p>

<ul><li>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.</li>

<li>JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.</li>

<li>JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.</li>

<li>Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.</li></ul>

<h3>JavaScript Development Tools</h4>
<p>One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler.<br>

To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here -</p>

<ul><li><b>Microsoft FrontPage -</b> Microsoft has developed a popular HTML editor called FrontPage. FrontPage also provides web developers with a number of JavaScript tools to assist in the creation of interactive websites.</li>

<li><b>Macromedia Dreamweaver MX -</b> Macromedia Dreamweaver MX is a very popular HTML and JavaScript editor in the professional web development crowd. It provides several handy prebuilt JavaScript components, integrates well with databases, and conforms to new standards such as XHTML and XML.</li>

<li><b>Macromedia HomeSite 5 -</b> HomeSite 5 is a well-liked HTML and JavaScript editor from Macromedia that can be used to manage personal websites effectively.</li></ul>
<h2> Inroduction </h2>

<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.x. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <code>Array</code>, <code>Date</code>, and <code>Math</code>, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

<ul>
 <li><em>Client-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
 <li><em>Server-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

<h2 id="JavaScript_and_Java" name="JavaScript_and_Java">JavaScript and Java</h2>

<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

<p>Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>

<p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>
